# Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus Guide

## Required Software

- [A version of PCSX2 which supports PINE (recommended: 2.2.0)](https://pcsx2.net/downloads)

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your options by visiting
the [Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus Options Page](/games/Sly%20Cooper%20and%20the%20Thievius%20Raccoonus/player-options).
