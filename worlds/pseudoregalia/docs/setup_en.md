# Pseudoregalia Setup Guide

## Requirements
* [Pseudoregalia AP Mod](https://github.com/qwint/pseudoregalia-archipelago/releases)

## Optional
* [Poptracker Bundle](https://github.com/Br00ty/pseudoregalia_brooty)

## Mod Installation
* Go to the [Mod Releases page](https://github.com/qwint/pseudoregalia-archipelago/releases/latest) and download the latest version of pseudoregalia-archipelago.zip.
* In Steam/steamapps/common, make a copy of your Pseudoregalia folder and rename it "Pseudoregalia_AP" (or whatever else you like).
* Extract the contents of pseudoregalia-archipelago.zip directly into "Pseudoregalia_AP". You should see README.md appear in the folder.
* Create a shortcut to Pseudoregalia_AP/pseudoregalia.exe and rename it "Pseudoregalia_AP" (or whatever else you like). Place it on your desktop or in your games folder or whatever.
* Launch the shortcut, which should open Pseudoregalia. Start a new file.


## Joining an Archipelago Session
### Connecting to server
Once the game is launched through the shortcut and a new file has been started, press F10 to open the in-game console, and enter your connect message:
```
/connect ip:port slotname password
```

## Known Issues
* The mod will not always fully load before starting the game, especially the first time. If the AP logo doesn't appear in the top right corner of the main menu, try restarting the game.
* If you're on top of an item when you first connect, it won't spawn until you reload the scene.
