# Here Comes Niko!
## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Here Comes Niko! AP Randomizer randomizes every reward(even frogs!) in the game and adds new items which unlock areas and locations.

Areas can only be accessed by finding the corresponding ticket. For example, you need to find the `Turbine Town Ticket` item to access Turbine Town

The goal is to either reach **Pepper's Interview** and get hired or get the **Employee Of The Month!** achievement. The coin amount required to buy at the Kiosk is randomized

## Changes from the vanilla game

A few changes have been made to the game for a better experience as a randomizer:

- Several requirements for achievements have been toned down.
- Coins and Cassettes stay throughout the game and don't get consumed when purchasing.
- Animation skipping

## What Here Comes Niko! items can appear in other player's world?

Every item can appear in other worlds

## What does another world's item look like in Here Comes Niko!?

In Here Comes Niko!, items from other worlds will show up as the Archipelago logo and based on the classification, will either show up as grey for filler, have a plus for useful and an arrow for progression.
If there's another Here Comes Niko! slot in the multiworld the items will show up as that item e.g: a coin will show up as a coin.
