"""
This module is used to set up visual mirroring of maps in a static way.
Specific Maps can be chosen to always be mirrored, always be not mirrored, or
always be 50/50 within this module.
For maps which are not set here, the chosen value for the "Mirror Mode" setting
is used as a fallback, so either "none mirrored", "all mirrored" or
"50/50 chance to mirror".
