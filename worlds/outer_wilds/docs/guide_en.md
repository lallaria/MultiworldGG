# Outer Wilds Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Outer Wilds installed
- Install the [Outer Wilds Mod Manager](https://outerwildsmods.com/mod-manager/)

### Modding and Running Outer Wilds

- In the Outer Wilds Mod Manager, click on "Get Mods", search for "Archipelago Randomizer", and once you see this mod listed, click the install button to the right of it (if you were wondering about the .zip file we didn't download earlier, that's what the Mod Manager is installing).
- (**Optional: Other Mods**) Some other mods that I personally like to play with, and that this randomizer is compatible with, include: "Clock" (exactly what it sounds like), "Cheat and Debug Menu" (for its fast-forward button), and "Suit Log" (access the ship log from your suit).
- Now click the big green Run Game button. Note that you must launch Outer Wilds through the Mod Manager in order for the mods to be applied; launching from Steam won't work.
- Once you're at the main menu of Outer Wilds itself, make sure your current profile / save file is one you're fine with overwriting. If you aren't sure: click Switch Profile to see a menu with all of your existing profiles, as well as the option to create a brand new profile. Return to the main menu when you're sure you're on the profile you want.
- Now click "New Random Expedition", and you will be asked for connection info such as the hostname and port number. Unless you edited `Outer.Wilds.yaml` (or used multiple `.yaml`s), your slot/player name will be "Hearthian1". And by default, multiworld.gg rooms have no password.
