# Subnautica Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Monster Sanctuary from [Monster Sanctuary Steam Store Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/814370/Monster_Sanctuary/)
- Archipelago Mod for Monster Sanctuary from [Github](https://github.com/Gtaray/archipelago-monstersanctuary/releases/latest/download/Monster_Sanctuary_Mod.zip)

## Optional Software

- [Poptracker Pack](https://github.com/Cyb3RGER/monster_sanctuary_ap_pack)

## Installation Procedure

*  Unpack the Archipelago Mod into your Monster Sanctuary folder, so that `Monster Sanctuary/BepInEx` is a valid path.
* Launch the game and close it. This will finalise the installation for BepInEx.
* Launch the game again and you should see a new bit of UI in the top-left of the screen showing Archipelago v0.4.4 Status: Not Connected, as well as text fields to enter connection info.

## Connecting

* Once you start the game with the client mod, you can connect to an MWGG server by selecting either "New Game" or "Continue". 
* If you are starting a new file, you will be prompted to enter the connection information for the MWGG server. This information is then saved along with the game's file slot, and will allow you to quickly reconnect when continuing the save file.
* When you want to Continue a save file, if that save file has connection information associated with it, you will be prompted to connect to that MWGG server before loading the game.

NOTE: The client mod prevents you from loading an MWGG save file while not connected to MWGG, and will not let you load a vanilla save file while connected to MWGG.
