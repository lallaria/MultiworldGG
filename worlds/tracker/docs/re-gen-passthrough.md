However with some games, the internal logic state of UT and the **actual** state of the server don't match, this is usually caused by the game implementing randomness in the logic that isn't soley tied to items

When this happens the World Dev needs to use one of a few hooks that UT provides to allow UT to properly track the logic

# generation_is_fake

The first method is `generation_is_fake`. This value is added to the multiworld object when UT is doing the internal generations so that worlds have the ability to not perform useless (for UT) randomization.  
For example, if the world only creates the locations based on what items get randomly created, if this flag exists, the world can insteed create all locations, and depend on the "real" server only sending the items that got actually created to limit what locations are expected to be completed.  

This can be checked in world logic with `hasattr(world.multiworld, "generation_is_fake")`  

# interpret_slot_data

The Second hook is for the world to define a function called `interpret_slot_data` that takes in a dict as a parameter  
If a world implements this function, after UT's internal generation when the tracker connects to the slot on the server, it will pass the slot_data (that the original world created) to the internal world  
This allows for the internal world to have a space in time before logic is tracked to modify any connections/settings it can in runtime, to correct any differences between it and the actual state on the server

However not all settings can be changed **after** generation occurs, so there's another hook available to world devs to provide UT support in their apworlds

# re_gen_passthrough

If the `interpret_slot_data` function returns non-None, this will cause UT to restart generation, but this time passing in whatever was returned as an extra value in the multiworld gen

The value will be added to the `multiworld.re_gen_passthrough` dict, with the key being the game name.  
This is to prevent a game trying to process a different game's `interpret_slot_data` (like if there's more then one game with UT support in the internal multiworld)

# Location Alias

UT provides a way for the world to alias a generically named location to give a more useful name on a slot by slot instance

If the world wants to rename their locations, they just need to define a map( `location_id_to_alias: Dict[int, str]` ) from location_id to alias_string on the world, and if a location id is found in the map, the alias name will be appended to the entry in UT
