# Powerwash Simulator for MultiworldGG

## Where is the options page?

You can read through all the options and generate a YAML [here](../player-options).

## What has been changed?

- Can only play in Free Play
- Levels are locked and need an unlock item to play them
  - unlock item is random
- Starting level is random unless you use the yaml setting
- Levels will hide themselves once all their checks are done
- Can choose which levels to add to the level pool
- All free dlc is added except `Seasonal Specials`
  - be careful: `Seasonal Specials` do NOT count (I can't delete them as hard as I may try)
- Objectsanity
  - Cleaning individual parts gives checks
- Current Goal Condition is McGuffin Hunt
- Includes local fill (not adjustable)

## Special Thanks

- Silent for programming support
- BadMagic for telling me about IlRepack
