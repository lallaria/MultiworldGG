#What are these JSONs?

These are the JSONs for games with special features, which aren't in most games.
Specifically:
Star Revenge 7, Star Revenge 7.5, and Star Revenge 8 have badge support, which means if you use them, badges (a collectable in these games specifically) will be randomized
Star Revenge 6.25 has 216 stars, compared to the normal max of 208, and it also has 2 stars which unlock cannons, and an extra switch.
Star Revenge 3.5 has the Black Switch, which like the Yellow Switch in sr6.25 is an extra switch to unlock

These JSONs are not editable in the JSON generator website due to the extra features not being widespread, if you need to edit them you should just edit the text file.
