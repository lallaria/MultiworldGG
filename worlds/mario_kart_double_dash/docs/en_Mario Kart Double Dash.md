# Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

## What does randomization do to this game?

Characters, karts, items, cups and access to time trial courses are shuffled into the item pool. There's also upgrades for the karts and character specific items. The courses in the cups can be also shuffled. The locations include winning races in each course, getting bronze/silver/gold cups at various vehicle classes and winning races with certain character/kart/course combinations (for example, win with Mario driving Red Fire or win with Daisy at Daisy Cruiser).

## What is the goal of the game?

Collect enough gold trophies and finish All Cup Tour.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Currently there is no in-game notification system and the game generally doesn't have any visual indication of what's unlocked. You can refer to the client to see what's unlocked (there's a nifty `/unlocked` command which tells you what do you have).

## What game modes are available?

Grand Prix and Time Trial. 2 players on one kart should work, but is untested (you may want to enable 2 player time trials cheat code to be able to get all the checks). 3-4 players is unsupported.
