## FAQ

### I launched this mod and my save is gone? Did rando delete my save?

Don't worry, your vanilla saves are intact. When playing this mod, a per-session savefile will be created. Your normal save file will not be touched.

### I got Letter to Kafei and now I can't use the Pendant of Memories! Is it just gone?

Try moving your cursor to the Letter to Kafei and pressing the N64's L button. That should cycle through all quest items in that slot. That's true for the Moon's Tear item slot and the Room Key item slot as well.

### I opened a chest/got a check and it always shows a grey Archipelago item, what's wrong with you?

The phantom AP item means the check is not yet implemented. Please use a text client or Seto's/G4M3RL1F3's amazing poptracker pack from step 5 to see checks that you can definitely get (though some implemented checks may be missing until the tracker is updated).

If you picked up a phantom on a check that should be implemented, you can open an issue on this repo letting us know!

## Known Issues

- Kotake sometimes does not show the price of her shopsanity item in the second dialogue.
- Trying to buy a progression item normally sold in a shop (such as the Bomb Bag) will not work, but will take your Rupees anyway.
