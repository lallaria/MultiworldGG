# Sonic Heroes for MultiWorld.GG

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## How does Sonic Heroes work with AP?
The entire game is handled through the level select (challenge) menu and separates the game into gates. Each gate has a random boss that can be unlocked by collecting a specified number of emblems and that must be beaten to unlock the next gate. Emblems among many other items can be collected by completing stages, killing enemies with Team Dark, collecting rings with Team Rose, and completing objectives with Team Chaotix.

The final gate will always have Metal Madness as a boss. Your game ends on beating Metal Overlord.
