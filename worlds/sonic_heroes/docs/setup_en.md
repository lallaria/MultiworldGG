# Sonic Adventure 2: Battle Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

* A legally obtained copy of the PC Version of Sonic Heroes
* [Reloaded-II Mod Loader](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II)

First, follow the setup for [Reloaded Mod Loader](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II)

## Optional Software
* [SafeDsicShim](https://github.com/RibShark/SafeDiscShim/releases) \[CD RELEASE ONLY\]

Once you've set up the Sonic Heroes application, go to the add mods page in Reloaded-II, search for Sonic Heroes MultiworldGG client, and install the mod.

After a world is hosted, in Reloaded, enable the Mod and click Configure. A UI will open up and you can set a server, port, slot name and password (if required).

Finally, launch the game through Reloaded and if the mod is enabled and the correct settings are set the Mod will connect to AP.
If you know you have the NoCD release, you can skip the following section.

### FOR CD RELEASE

If you are running using the SafeDiscShim setup, you will not be able to load the mods directly. Instead, you'll need to launch first then inject after.

To do this, go to the application in Reloaded-II and select edit application. Expand the `Advanced Tools & Options` dropdown and select `Don't Inject Loader`.

When you launch the game, you'll see the game appear in the processes list in Reloaded-II. Click the listing and press `Inject` to load the mods.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

After a world is hosted, in Reloaded, enable the Mod and click Configure. A UI will open up and you can set a server, port, slot name and password (if required).

Once you have the game booting, check the log that appears to ensure you're connected. If you're not, check your mod configuration and try again.

If you connect successfully, you should then create a save file. You'll have to manage your saves manually but you have 99 slots so it shouldn't be too hard.

At the start of an AP session, either start a new save or delete an old one and start a new one in its slot. You can reselect this slot without any issues if you need to relaunch.

The entire session is handled through the level select menu under `Challenge`. You will not be able to select any other options if connected to AP.
