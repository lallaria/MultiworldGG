# Placid Plastic Duck Simulator Setup Guide

## How to install

- Download [BepInEx 6 IL2Cpp Bleeding Edge v.735](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be/735/BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.735%2B5fef357.zip).
- Extract the BepInEx zip folder you downloaded from the previous step into your game's install directory (For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Placid Plastic Duck Simulator)
- Launch the game and close it. This will finalize the BepInEx installation.
- Download and extract the `SW_CreeperKing.ArchipelagoMod.Zip` from the [release page](https://github.com/SWCreeperKing/PPDSArchipelago/releases).
    - Copy the `SW_CreeperKing.ArchipelagoMod` folder from the release zip into `BepInEx/plugins` under your game's install directory.
- Launch the game again and you should see the connection input on the top left of the title screen!
- To uninstall the mod, either remove/delete the `SW_CreeperKing.ArchipelagoMod` folder from the plugins folder or rename the winhttp.dll file located in the game's root directory (this will disable all installed mods from running).
