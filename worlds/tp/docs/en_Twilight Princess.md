# Twilight Princess

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items get shuffled between the different locations in the game, so each playthrough is unique. Randomized locations might include chests, items received from NPCs, Golden Bugs, Poes, and more. The randomizer also includes quality-of-life features such as a fully-opened world, removing many cutscenes, transform anywhere, and more. Note: These QOL settings cannot be changed currently.

## Which locations get shuffled?

All locations will be given an item. According to settings some locations can be set to not have progession or usefull items so you can ignore that location.

## What is the goal of Twilight Princess?

Reach and defeat Ganondorf in Hyrule Castle. This will require the Master Sword (Light filled is not needed), and any other items necessary to reach Ganondorf.

## What does another world's item look like in TP?

Currently all items are a green rupee, if the item is part of your world you will be given it after closing the text box.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, it will be added to a queue, where link will get the items one by one. Like many other Zelda randomizers, Link **will** hold the item out causing him to pause so be ready.

## Do the in-game hints mean anything?

No, those hints are based off of the contents of the locations which are all Green Rupees.
