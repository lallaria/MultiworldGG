# Ape Escape Setup Guide

## Required Software
- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases). Please use version 0.4.4 or later for integrated
BizHawk support.
- Ape Escape (USA) ISO or BIN/CUE.
- [BizHawk](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory) 2.7 or later. Other emulators are not supported.
- The latest `apeescape.apworld` file. You can find this on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Thedragon005/Archipelago-Ape-Escape/releases/latest). Put this in your `Archipelago/custom_worlds` folder.

### Configuring BizHawk

Once you have installed BizHawk, open `EmuHawk.exe` and change the following settings:

- If you're using BizHawk 2.7 or 2.8, go to `Config > Customize`. On the Advanced tab, switch the Lua Core from
`NLua+KopiLua` to `Lua+LuaInterface`, then restart EmuHawk. (If you're using BizHawk 2.9, you can skip this step.)
- Under `Config > Customize`, check the "Run in background" option to prevent disconnecting from the client while you're
tabbed out of EmuHawk.
- Open any PlayStation game in EmuHawk and go to `Config > Controllers…` to configure your inputs. If you can't click
`Controllers…`, it's because you need to load a game first.
- Consider clearing keybinds in `Config > Hotkeys…` if you don't intend to use them. Select the keybind and press Esc to
clear it.

## Generating a Game

1. Create your options file (YAML). After installing the `apeescape.apworld` file, you can generate a template within the Archipelago Launcher by clicking `Generate Template Settings`.
2. Follow the general Archipelago instructions for [generating a game](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#generating-a-game).
3. Open `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe`
4. Select "BizHawk Client" in the right-side column. On your first time opening BizHawk Client, you will also be asked to
locate `EmuHawk.exe` in your BizHawk install.

## Connecting to a Server

1. If EmuHawk didn't launch automatically, open it manually.
2. Open your Ape Escape (USA) ISO or CUE file in EmuHawk.
3. In EmuHawk, go to `Tools > Lua Console`. This window must stay open while playing. Be careful to avoid clicking "TAStudio" below it in the menu, as this is known to delete your savefile.
4. In the Lua Console window, go to `Script > Open Script…`.
5. Navigate to your Archipelago install folder and open `data/lua/connector_bizhawk_generic.lua`.
6. The emulator and client will eventually connect to each other. The BizHawk Client window should indicate that it
connected and recognized Ape Escape.
7. To connect the client to the server, enter your room's address and port (e.g. `archipelago.gg:38281`) into the
top text field of the client and click Connect.

You should now be able to receive and send items. You'll need to do these steps every time you want to reconnect. It is
perfectly safe to make progress offline; everything will re-sync when you reconnect.

## Tips on joystick configuration for Ape Escape on Bizhawk

Analog sensitivity in Bizhawk can be a bit of a pain to get working at first.
You may need to bind them inverted to how you expect.
The first time, you'll want to go up to the menu at the top of Bizhawk, click PSX, open the settings,
go to the Sync Settings tab, scroll down a little bit, and make sure Virtual Port 1 is set to dualanalog.
If you don't, analog sticks will be a little weird when running exactly to the right
