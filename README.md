## History

MultiworldGG is built upon the initial work of the core team of the Archipelago project and the amazing contributions of dozens of world developers and skilled community emembers. 
The repositories which MultiworldGG is built upon, inspired by, or otherwise owes its gratitude to are:

* [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago)
* [bonta0's MultiWorld](https://github.com/Bonta0/ALttPEntranceRandomizer/tree/multiworld_31)
* [AmazingAmpharos' Entrance Randomizer](https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/ALttPEntranceRandomizer)
* [VT Web Randomizer](https://github.com/sporchia/alttp_vt_randomizer)
* [Dessyreqt's alttprandomizer](https://github.com/Dessyreqt/alttprandomizer)
* [Zarby89's](https://github.com/Ijwu/Enemizer/commits?author=Zarby89)
  and [sosuke3's](https://github.com/Ijwu/Enemizer/commits?author=sosuke3) contributions to Enemizer, which make up the
  vast majority of Enemizer contributions.

We recognize that there is a strong community of incredibly smart people that have come before us and helped pave the
path. Just because one person's name may be in a repository title does not mean that only one person made that project
happen. We can't hope to perfectly cover every single contribution that lead up to MultiworldGG, but we hope to honor
them fairly.

### Path to the MultiworldGG

MultiworldGG was directly forked from Archipelago in 2024. 
Originally, it was just used as a quick and easy access solution for a small group of friends. Some members who were less tech savvy wanted to jump in and needed easier setup and access, so we started doing our own thing with custom APWorlds.

Over time, the repository grew significantly, and we started making changes to the core, especially in regards to the webhost and the local client.
At some point, we felt independent enough to provide our solution to the public, hoping that other people will profit from the simplicity this fork can provide.
